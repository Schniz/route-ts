# 🍰 `route-ts`

An experimental type-safe layered routing system.

🔒 **Fully type-safe.** No `any` or even `Record<string, any>` types anywhere.
🕸 **Layered routing.** Routes are a composition of smaller middleware-like layers.
🚮 **Fully tree-shakable and dead-code-eliminable.** Only the layers you use will be included in your final bundle.
🧩 **Extensible.** Add your own layers to the routing system, install new layers from npm, or use the provided ones.
